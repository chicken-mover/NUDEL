# NUDEL
New Uruk Derived Extension Library

This is a repository for all plugins used by the 
[New Uruk](http://uruk.d3mok.net) Minecraft server.

Plugins are built to target [Spigot](http://spigotmc.org).

## Setting up your development environment

To test plugins you will need to set up a local testing environment. Spigot
installation instructions can be found here: http://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/

Once you have it up and running locally, clone this repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:chicken-mover/NUDEL.git
```

## Testing and building plugins

More to come!
