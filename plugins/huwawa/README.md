# Huwawa

This plugin utilizes the WorldGuard `game-mode` flag to enforce game modes in
regions. Unlike WorldGuard, Huwawa enforces this on all players, including
admins and ops, and disables certain op commands while in survival or adventure
regions.

When switching regions, any instances of the item that is assigned to be the
WorldEdit wand will also be removed from the player's inventory.

Players (including ops) may not teleport into survival or adventure regions.

## Commands

This plugin has no commands.

## Dependencies

Requires WorldEdit (6.x) and WorldGuard (6.x).
