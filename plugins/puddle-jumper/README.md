# Pudddle Jumper

Tools for setting flight paths and fixed time-of-day flights between the
Skyports of New Uruk. 

# Goals

* Define an aircraft using a WorldEdit selection.
* Schedule a flight, and define a destination and optional waypoints (max 3).
* Start the flight running.

Each time the flight runs, the aircraft and all players on board are teleported
to each waypoint, with a delay, giving a bit of a "flying time" experience.
