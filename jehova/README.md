Lightning/thunder and storm-related tools.

## Goals

* Commands for creating lightning and lightning effects (`/strike`, `/boom`, 
  `/cast`), optionally targeting players or coordinates (otherwise defaulting
  to player or command block's location).
* Localized thunder sounds (with little config file would be nice).
* Commands for toggling storm state (`/storm [on|off]`)
* Localized storms is probably impossible, but that would be neat.
